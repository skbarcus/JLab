\begin{abstract}
\hcal is a sampling calorimeter designed to measure the energy of several GeV protons and neutrons. It will be used for measuring hadron energy and triggering purposes in the upcoming Super BigBite Spectrometer (SBS) program to study nucleon form factors at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). \hcal has an energy resolution of ***\% and a position resolution of *** cm.

\section{Introduction}

\jlab uses the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) to accelerate electrons for scattering experiments. After a recently completed upgrade CEBAF is capable of accelerating electrons up to 12 GeV. This increased maximum energy allows the lab to probe higher \q regions than previously available. One aspect of this 12 GeV era is the Super BigBite Spectrometer (SBS) program in Hall A. SBS consists of the SBS dipole magnet which curves the trajectory of scattered hadrons, the \hcal for energy measurements, Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) for particle tracking, polarimeters, a coordinate detector, and the refurbished BigBite detector package which includes a hodoscope, gas Cherenkov, and shower calorimeters \cite{brio_2018}. The SBS program will measure the nucleon form factors $G_M^n$ \cite{gmn_proposal}, $G_E^n$ \cite{gen_proposal}, and $G_E^p$ \cite{gep_proposal} at significantly higher \q than has been done before. \\

Since the initial measurement of the proton's electromagnetic form factors in the 1950's \cite{hofstadter_1956} great strides have been made in understanding the nucleon form factors. By the 1990's the nucleon form factors: $G_E^p$, $G_M^p$, $G_E^n$, and $G_M^n$ were found to generally follow a dipole description $F_{dipole} = \left( 1+\frac{Q^2}{0.71 \;GeV^2}\right)^{-2}$ \cite{bosted_1995}. The ratio of the proton's Sachs form factors, $R_p(Q^2) = \mu_{p}\frac{G_E^p}{G_M^p}$, was found to be approximately unity up to $Q^2$ $\approx$ 1 GeV. However, the nucleon form factor data up until the the mid 1990's all came from unpolarized Rosenbluth separations.

At the turn of the century physicists began measuring the nucleon form factors using the polarization transfer method first proposed in the late 1950's \cite{polarization_transfer} as well as the double polarization method proposed in the early 1980's \cite{double_polarization} ***(check correct paper). 

\section{Hadron Calorimeter}

\hcal consists of 288 individual modules arranged in 12 columns and 24 rows as shown in Figure \ref{fig:HCal}. These modules are spread across four craneable subassemblies, and the detector weighs approximately 40 tons in total. Each module is made up of 40 layers of 1 cm thick scintillator (PPO only, 2,5-Diphenyloxazole) alternating with 40 layers of 1.5 cm thick iron absorbers as shown in Figure \ref{fig:HCal_interior}, and each module measures 15$\times$15 cm$^2$ with a length of 1 m. The hadrons strike the iron causing them to shower, and the scintillators produce photons from these shower particles. In the center of the iron and scintillators is a St. Gobain BC-484 wavelength shifter (decay time 3 ns) which improves light collection efficiency and uniformity \cite{brio_2018}. The photons in the wavelength shifter are transported to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) on one end of the modules via custom built light guides that can be seen in the lower image of Figure \ref{fig:HCal_interior}.

	{\bf{SBS Hadron Calorimeter Module Interior.}} The interior of each \hcal module is comprised of alternating layers of iron absorbers and scintillators. The hadrons shower in the iron and then these showers create photons in the scintillators. These photons pass through a wavelength shifter before being transported into the PMTs via light guides.
