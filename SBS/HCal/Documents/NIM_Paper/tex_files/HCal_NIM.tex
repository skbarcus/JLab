\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

\jlab uses the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) to accelerate electrons for scattering experiments. After a recently completed upgrade CEBAF is capable of accelerating electrons up to 12 GeV. This increased maximum energy allows the lab to probe higher \q regions than previously available. One aspect of this 12 GeV era is the Super BigBite Spectrometer (SBS) program in Hall A. SBS consists of the SBS dipole magnet which curves the trajectory of scattered hadrons, the \hcal for energy measurements, Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) for particle tracking, polarimeters, a coordinate detector, and the refurbished BigBite detector package which includes a hodoscope, gas Cherenkov, and shower calorimeters \cite{brio_2018}. The SBS program will measure the nucleon form factors $G_M^n$ \cite{gmn_proposal}, $G_E^n$ \cite{gen_proposal}, and $G_E^p$ \cite{gep_proposal} at significantly higher \q than has been done before. \\

Since the initial measurement of the proton's electromagnetic form factors in the 1950's \cite{hofstadter_1956} great strides have been made in understanding the nucleon form factors. By the 1990's the nucleon form factors: $G_E^p$, $G_M^p$, $G_E^n$, and $G_M^n$ were found to generally follow a dipole description $F_{dipole} = \left( 1+\frac{Q^2}{0.71 \;GeV^2}\right)^{-2}$ \cite{bosted_1995}. The ratio of the proton's Sachs form factors, $R_p(Q^2) = \mu_{p}\frac{G_E^p}{G_M^p}$, was found to be approximately unity up to $Q^2$ $\approx$ 1 GeV. However, the nucleon form factor data up until the the mid 1990's all came from unpolarized Rosenbluth separations.\\

At the turn of the century physicists began measuring the nucleon form factors using the polarization transfer method first proposed in the late 1950's \cite{polarization_transfer} as well as the double polarization method proposed in the early 1980's \cite{double_polarization} ***(check correct paper). These polarization techniques are far less sensitive to two photon exchange effects than traditional Rosenbluth separations. Since the early 2000's many such polarization measurements of the nucleon form factors have been made in the high \q region of $1\; \text{GeV}^2 < Q^2 < 10\; \text{GeV}^2$. These new polarization measurements were in stark disagreement with form factor measurements from Rosenbluth techniques in this higher $Q^2$ region. Polarization methods indicated that the ratio of the proton's form factors, $R_p(Q^2)$, diverged from unity with the proton electric form factor falling off far more rapidly than the magnetic form factor as shown in Figure \ref{fig:polarization_vs_rosenbluth}. Whereas, the Rosenbluth results remained consistent with an $R_p(Q^2) \approx 1$, albeit with larger uncertainties than the polarized measurements.\\

The SBS nucleon form factor experiments will explore even higher \q regions than previously. The $G_M^n$ experiment with measure the magnetic form factor of the neutron by measuring quasielastic electron scattering cross section ratios d(e,e'n)p/d(e,e'p)n off of liquid deuterium \cite{gmn_proposal}. The $G_E^n$ experiment will measure the $G_E^n$/$G_M^n$ ratio using the double polarization technique to measure the asymmetry of electron scattering off of polarized $^3$He \cite{gen_proposal}. Using the high-precision $G_M^n$ data acquired by SBS $G_E^n$ can be directly extracted from this ratio. The $G_E^p$ experiment will measure the ratio $G_E^p$/$G_M^p$ at high $Q^2$ using the polarization transfer method to scatter electrons from a liquid(***check) hydrogen target \cite{gep_proposal}. Table \ref{tab:q2_ranges} summarizes the \q ranges to be measured by the SBS nucleon form factor experiments.\\

	Precision measurements of the nucleon form factors will improve uncertainties at lower $Q^2$, while at high \q these measurements will offer important new physics insights. These measurements are a rigorous test for competing lattice QCD, pQCD, VMD models, and effective field theory predictions which have large disagreements in the high \q region (*** add plot showing theory curves?). This new data will also increase the \q range of the form factor flavor decompositions. Additionally, because the nucleon form factors $F_1$ and $F_2$ equal the first moments of the $H^q$ and $E^q$ generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs), the nucleon form factors provide an important constraint for developing GPD models \cite{gen_proposal}. The $H^q$ and $E^q$ GPDs are directly related to quark orbital angular momentum \cite{cisbani_2014}(***maybe use his ref 5) meaning nucleon form factor measurements will provide tantalizing new insight into this quantity. \\ 

\section{Hadron Calorimeter}
\label{hcal}

\hcal consists of 288 individual modules arranged in 12 columns and 24 rows as shown in Figure \ref{fig:HCal}. These modules are spread across four craneable subassemblies, and the detector weighs approximately 40 tons in total. Each module is made up of 40 layers of 1 cm thick scintillator (PPO only, 2,5-Diphenyloxazole) alternating with 40 layers of 1.5 cm thick iron absorbers as shown in Figure \ref{fig:HCal_interior}, and each module measures 15$\times$15 cm$^2$ with a length of 1 m. The hadrons strike the iron causing them to shower, and the scintillators produce photons from these shower particles. In the center of the iron and scintillators is a St. Gobain BC-484 wavelength shifter (decay time 3 ns) which improves light collection efficiency and uniformity \cite{brio_2018}. The photons in the wavelength shifter are transported to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) on one end of the modules via custom built light guides that can be seen in the lower image of Figure \ref{fig:HCal_interior}.\\

\subsection{Cabling System}
\label{cables}

The cabling scheme for the \hcal is designed such that all detector channels can be accessed at numerous points between the detector PMTs and where the final signals enter the DAQ electronics. The \hcal cable system can be broken into three groups based on whether the physics signals flow to the fADC250s or the F1TDCs discussed in Section \ref{daq} or the summing modules discussed in Section \ref{electronics}. Five racks hold the front-end and DAQ cabling and electronics and a diagrammatic layout of these racks is show in Figures \ref{fig:fe} and \ref{fig:daq}. The front-end racks are labelled RR1, RR2, and RR3. The electronics and cables in RR1 and RR3 are mirrored as each of these racks contains half of the \hcal channels. The DAQ side racks are RR4 and RR5. The DAQ side is connected to the front-end via 100 m*** long BNC cables running from RR2 to RR4. \\

	\caption{
	{\bf{\hcal Front-End Layout.}} The front-end consists of racks RR1, RR2, and RR3. Signal enters the front-end through the amplifiers at the bottoms of racks RR1 and RR3. RR1 and RR3 are mirrored and each handle half of the 288 \hcal channels. The front-end is connected to the DAQ side via 100 m*** long BNC cables connecting RR2 to RR4.}

	\end{figure}	
	
	\begin{figure}[!ht]

	\end{center}
	\caption{
	{\bf{\hcal DAQ Layout.}} The DAQ side consists of racks RR4 and RR5. Rack RR5 contains the fADC250s and F1TDCs into which the physics signal flows. The DAQ side is connected to the front-end via 100 m*** long BNC cables connecting RR4 to RR2.}
	\label{fig:daq}
	\end{figure}	

Beginning at the detector PMTs the physics signal can be traced to the fADC250s, from which both energy and timing measurements can be made. The analog signal exits the detector PMTs and enters the Phillips Scientific 776 amplifiers at the base of RR1 and RR3 depending on from which half of the detector the signal originated. The PS776 amplifiers have dual outputs which each produce a 10$\times$ amplified analog signal. From one of these outputs the amplified physics signal flows to patch panels in the bottom of RR2 which connect to DAQ side patch panels at the base of RR4 via 100 m*** long BNC cables. Once emerging from RR4 on the DAQ side the signals flow into the fADC250s in RR5 and are recorded for analysis. The following list gives each component dedicated to processing the fADC signals in the order in which the signal passes through them:\\

\begin{itemize}\itemsep6pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item 288 detector PMTs (192 of the PMTs are 12 stage 2'' Photonis XP2262 PMTs and 96 are 8 stage stage 2'' Photonis XP2282 PMTs).

\end{itemize}

Timing information is derived from F1TDCs and flows through the front-end and DAQ side electronics in the following manner. An analog signal first exits the detector PMTs and flows into the Phillips Scientific 776 10$\times$ amplifiers at the base of RR1 and RR3 depending on from which half of the detector the signal originated. Exiting the second of the two PS776 outputs the amplified analog signal travels to a 50-50 splitter panel with two sets of outputs. The halved signal then exits the first set of these outputs and travels to Phillips Scientific 706 discriminators with low ($\approx 11 mV$) thresholds in RR2. This now NIM logic signal passes into patch panels in RR2 and then over 100 m*** long BNC-BNC*** cables which connect to patch panels in RR4. After leaving the patch panels the physics signals enter a second set of LeCroy 2313 discriminators which ensure the signal shape continues to have a sharp leading edge. The second set of discriminators translate the signal into an ECL signal which then flows into the F1TDCs to be recorded. The following list gives each component dedicated to processing the F1TDC signals in the order in which the signal passes through them:\\

\begin{itemize}\itemsep6pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item 288 detector PMTs (192 of the PMTs are 12 stage 2'' Photonis XP2262 PMTs and 96 are 8 stage stage 2'' Photonis XP2282 PMTs).

\end{itemize}

The third set of signals leading to the summing modules takes the following path. An analog signal first exits the detector PMTs and flows into the Phillips Scientific 776 10$\times$ amplifiers at the base of RR1 and RR3 depending on from which half of the detector the signal originated. Exiting the second of the two PS776 outputs the amplified analog signal travels to a 50-50 splitter panel with two sets of outputs. The halved signal then exits the second set of these outputs and travels to to the summing modules which sum the analog signal of 16 PMTs for triggering and analysis purposes. The following list gives each component dedicated to processing the summing module signals in the order in which the signal passes through them:\\

\begin{itemize}\itemsep6pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
