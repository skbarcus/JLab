Preprocessing_SBS4.py is the code which preprocesses the data extracted by traditional physics cuts. (The code that looks at the raw data is on the ifarm at /work/halla/sbs/skbarcus/HCal_replay/hcal/BB_HCal_Coorelations/plot_BB_HCAL_correlations_skbarcus.C)

GMn_SBS4_NN.ipynb is the python notebook which finishes shaping the data and then defines and trains a DNN on that data to identify elastic events.
